## How-to-set-it-up

### Solid connection

First off all you have to make an account on [Solid Community](https://solidcommunity.net/).
If you created your account you will have to go to your preferences and change your user type to developer. So the application can update and delete the files you are sending in.

### Firebase setup

For this section you will have to create an .env file and setup a database at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). When you have an account and an project in Firebase you will have create your Realtime Database. If you have done all that you will need aan .env file with the following items:

    REACT_APP_apiKey= "apiKey"
    REACT_APP_authDomain= "authDomain"
    REACT_APP_projectId= "covid-solid-app"
    REACT_APP_databaseURL= "your database url"
    REACT_APP_storageBucket="storageBucket"
    REACT_APP_messagingSenderId= "messagingSenderId"
    REACT_APP_appId= "appId"

These items you can find at your project settings. The database url will not be under project settings but on the Realtime Database the first link you see.

There are some rules you can set for your database but these are optional if you just want to test the project out. You can edit these at the rules tab in your Realtime database.

    {
      "rules": {
        ".write": true,
        "covid-items": {
                ".read": "auth.uid != null",
      },
            "users":{
          ".read": "auth.uid != null",
            }
      }
    }

### Project setup

Just pull in the repository and place the .env file in the folder that has been pulled in.

#### `yarn`

This will download all the packages needed for development and production.
After yarn has created the node_modules you can run the following commands:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
